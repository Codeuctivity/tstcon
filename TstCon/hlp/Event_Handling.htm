<h2 style="page-break-after: auto">Event Handling</h2>
<p class="Text">Test Container Automation scripts can contain functions that 
handle events generated by controls on the form.<br>
<br>
Any VBScript Sub whose name is of the form <span class="Italic">controlname</span><span class="Bold">_</span><span class="Italic">eventname</span> 
will automatically handle the <span class="Italic">eventname</span> event of
<span class="Italic">controlname</span> control.&nbsp; This automatic association is 
created when the script is loaded.&nbsp; This means that any controls for which the 
script has event handlers must already exist on the form with the proper name 
when the script is loaded.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The easiest way to do this is to place all of the desired controls on the form, 
set each control’s name using the Extended page on its property sheet, and then 
load the script that contains the event handlers. To avoid repeating these 
steps, you can then save the session to a file.&nbsp; Loading a session loads all of 
the controls on the form, and then loads all of the scripts that were saved in 
that session.</p>
